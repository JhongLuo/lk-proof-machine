An automatic FOL proof machine based on Gentzen's sequent calculus

Three facts can be used to demonstrate GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem. First, programs can obtain its own code (without external assistance). Second, a Turing machine can be encoded into a first-order logic sentence. Third, there is an algorithm to search for proofs of first-order logic sentences (proofs are recognizable). This repository is a small demonstration of the third fact.
